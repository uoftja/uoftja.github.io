                    The University of Toronto Japan Association (UTJA) was established in May 2012 with the purpose of promoting and facilitating the exchange of Japanese culture and language between students and non-students both on and off campus. We are here to serve as a platform for people with an interest in Japan and its culture to connect with one another. 
                    We are dedicated to the promotion of Japanese culture and language, as well as promoting awareness of Japanese historical, political and social issues through various events. This club is fully run by students at the University of Toronto. 
                    Our activities include monthly cultural-themed events, socials, as well as weekly language exchange sessions. UTJA membership is by no means limited to University of Toronto students of Japanese origin or descent, as we seek to enrich the university experience by creating a welcoming community for those interested in Japanese culture.
